# CLI Visualisation of solving Tower of Hanoi recursion algorithm  
  
**1. Requirements**  
- fpc

**2. Help quick keys**   
- q - quit application
- p - pause visualization
- s - StepByStep mode, press any key to animate next step of solving

**3. Help program args**  
**hanoi-tower [arg1] [arg2] [arg3] [arg4]**  
- [arg1] - amount of rings (1 to 9)
- [arg2] - StepByStep mode (by default 0)
- [arg3] - FastAnimation mode (by default) (not so fast actually)
- [arg4] - AnimationDuration value  
  (1 - fastest, the more value the slower animation)

**4. Installation**  
I guess nothing special at this point(compile it),  
be sure that your system supports crt module of pascal


thanks
